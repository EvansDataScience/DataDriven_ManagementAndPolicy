# Session 2: Introduction to Programming in R
## Part A: Data Structures in R

<a id='beginning'></a>

Programming languages use _data structures_ to tell the computer how to organize the data we are working with. That is, data structures provided by a programming language are not the same in another one. However, in most cases, a name given to a data structure in one programming language should generally be the same in other one. It is worth keeping in mind, that a particular data structure may serve for one purpose, but not for other ones.  

In everyday life, a book can be considered a data structure: we use it to store some kind of information. It has some advantages: it has a table of contents; it has numbers on the pages; you can take it with you; read it as long as you can see the words; and read it again as many times as you want. It has some disadvantages: you can lose it, and need to buy it again; it can deteriorate; get eaten by an insect; and so on. 

We are going to talk about 3 data structures in R:

1. [Lists.](#part1) 
2. [Vectors.](#part2) 
3. [Data Frame.](#part3) 

**Lists** and **vectors** are simple structures; a **data frame** is a more complex one (built from the simple ones).

## List

Lists are containers of values. The values can be of any kind (numbers or non-numbers), and even other containers (simple or complex). If we have an spreadsheet as a reference, a row is a 'natural' list.

```{r CreatingList, eval=FALSE}
DetailStudent=list(fullName="Fred Meyers",
                   age=40,
                   female=FALSE)
```

The *object* 'DetailStudent' serves to store _temporarily_ the list in the computer. To name a list, use combinations of letters and numbers (never start with a number) in a meaningful way. Typing the name of the object 'DetailStudent', now a list, will give you all the contents you saved in there:
```{r ShowingList, eval=FALSE}
DetailStudent
```
Each of the elements in the list, in this case, holds a different type:

* *FullName* holds characters
* *age* holds a number
* *female* holds a logical (Boolean) value.

You can access individual elements like this:

```{r AccessingList, eval=FALSE}
DetailStudent[[1]]
# or
DetailStudent[['fullName']]
# or
DetailStudent$fullName
```

You can alter the list using any of the above mechanisms:
```{r AlteringLists, eval=FALSE}
DetailStudent$fullName='Alfred Mayer'
# Then:
DetailStudent
```

You can add an element like this:
```{r addElemList, eval=FALSE}
DetailStudent$city='Seattle'

# show:
DetailStudent
```

And destroy it by **NULL**ing it, like this:
```{r destroyElementList, eval=FALSE}
DetailStudent$city=NULL # do you like: DetailStudent[[4]]=NULL
```

## Vectors
Vectors are also containers of values. The values should be of __only one type__ (**R** may alter it silently, otherwise). If we have an spreadsheet as a reference, a column can be a natural vector (when rows and columns HAVE to be a vector we may need a **matrix**<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup>).

```{r CreatingVectors, eval=FALSE}
names=c("Fred Meyers","Sarah Jones", "Lou Ferrigno","Sky Turner")
ages=c(40,35, 60,77)
female=c(F,T,T,T)
```

Each *object* is holding temporarily a vector. Use combinations of letters and numbers (never start with a number) in a meaningful way to name a vector. When typing the name of the object you will get all the contents:
```{r ShowingVector, eval=FALSE}
names
ages
female
```

Each vector is composed of elements with the same type. If you want to access individual elements, you can write:

```{r AccessingVector, eval=FALSE}
names[1]
# or
ages[1]
# or
female[1]
```

You can alter the list using any of the above mechanisms:
```{r AlteringVector, eval=FALSE}
names[1]='Alfred Mayer'
# Then:
names[1]
```

You can add an element to a vector like this:
```{r addElemVec, eval=FALSE}
elements=c(1,2,3)
elements=c(elements,40) 
elements
```

You can NOT delete it with NULL:
```{r delElemVec, results='asis', echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
elements[4]=NULL
```

Just do this:
```{r delElemVecOK, eval=FALSE}
elements=elements[-4] # vector shrinks
```

Another important operation is to get rid of repeated values:
```{r uniqueVals, eval=FALSE}
weekdays=c('M','T','W','Th','S','Su','Su')
weekdays
```

Then, use the function _unique_:
```{r uniqueValsOK, eval=FALSE}
unique(weekdays)
```


Vector elements can have 'names', but their contents still need to be homogeneous:
```{r TroublesomeVector, eval=FALSE}
newAges=c("Sam"=50, "Paul"=30, "Name"="Jim")
newAges
```

As you saw above, the presence of "Jim" as an element, *coerced* the other values to *characters* (the _numbers_ are now _text_, the symbol **''** is used to show that). Eliminating that value will give an appropriate vector:

```{r CorrectingVector, eval=FALSE}
newAgesGood=c("Sam"=50, "Paul"=30)
newAgesGood
```

### Vectors versus Lists

Let me share some ideas for comparing these two basic structures:

__A) Make sure what you have:__

The functions **is.vector**, **is.list**, **is.character** and **is.numeric** should be used frequently, because we need to be sure of what structure we are dealing with:
```{r MakingSure_I, eval=FALSE}
is.vector(newAgesGood)
is.list(newAges)
is.list(DetailStudent)
is.vector(DetailStudent)
is.numeric(newAges[1])
is.character(newAges[1])
is.numeric(newAgesGood[1])
```

You may be wondering why we got DetailStudent as a vector. It is a list, but the function is.vector has the *argument* **mode** set to "any" by default:
```{r CheckingFunctionIsVector, eval=FALSE}
is.vector(DetailStudent,mode = 'any')
is.vector(DetailStudent,mode = 'vector')
```

The function **class**, **typeof**, and **str** could be another alternative to find out what we have:
```{r MakingSure_II, eval=FALSE}
typeof(newAges)
class(newAges)
str(newAges)
# and
class(DetailStudent)
typeof(DetailStudent)
str(DetailStudent)
```

__B) Make sure functions are shareable__

The function _length_ is pretty ubiquitous in R. In this case it works well for lists and vectors, precisely telling how many elements there are:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
length(DetailStudent)
length(newAges)
```

Notice that _length_ gives you the count at the top level (it is not smart to report the count inside of an composite element):
```{r, eval=FALSE}
# for lists:
listToCount=list(name='John', language_spoken=c('Spanish','English'))
length(listToCount)
```


The function _unique_, shown above to get rid of duplicates, is also used in lists. The good thing is that it also returns a list:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
aList=list(1,1,3,4,5)
unique(aList)
```

Pay attention if a function works for the same data structures, and if the function returns the same data structure or a different one when applied to a particular one. See the next operations.

When you compare  vectors ('>', '<', etc.), it will work **element by element**:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
vector1=c('b','c','d')
vector2=c('a','b','d')
vector1>vector2
```

If vectors have different sizes, comparison works if one has ONE element:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
vector3=c('a')
vector1>vector3 # each element of vector1 compared to the only one in vector3
```

Then, this confuses vectors:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
vector4=c('a','b')
vector1>vector4
```


This is also valid for vectors of numbers:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# if we have these vectors:
numbers1=c(1,2,3)
numbers2=c(1,2,3)
numbers3=c(5)
numbers4=c(1,10)
```
Then, these work well:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
# adding element by element:
numbers1+numbers2

# adding 5  to all the elements of other vector:
numbers1+numbers3

# multiplication (element by element):
numbers1*numbers2

# and this kind of multiplication:
numbers1 * numbers3
```

However, R will get confused here:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
numbers1+numbers4 # different size matters!
```


Now, let's see how the previous operations work here. These are our lists:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
numbersL1=list(11,22,33)
numbersL2=list(1,2,3)

```

...the _adding_ can not be interpreted:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
numbersL1+numbersL2
```
... and neither the comparisons...
```{r, eval=FALSE}
numbersL1>numbersL2
```
So do not expect neither of these to work:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
numbersL1*numbersL2
numbersL1*3
```

The last command (_numbersL1_*3) could be tried with the function __rep__, keeping in mind that you will not apply arithmetic to the list, but repeat it:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
rep(numbersL1,3) # repeat the list '3' times...
```

## Data Frames

Data frames are containers of values. You use a data frame because you need to combine what vectors and lists do. The most common analogy is a data table like  the ones in a __spreadsheet__: 

```{r CreatingDF, eval=FALSE}
# VECTORS
names=c("Qing", "Françoise", "Raúl", "Bjork")
ages=c(32,33,28,30)
country=c("China", "Senegal", "Spain", "Norway")
education=c("Bach", "Bach", "Master", "PhD")

#DF as a "List" of vectors:
students=data.frame(ages,country,education,row.names=names)
students
```

You see your data frame above. Just by watching, you can not be sure of what you have, so using **str** is highly recommended:
```{r strDF, eval=FALSE}
str(students)
```

This data frame uses the vector 'names' as the __row names__, so that vector is not considered a column, that is fine:
```{r rowsDF, eval=FALSE}
students[1,] #first row
students['Qing',] # row with 'Qing' as row name
# this is wrong: students['Qing']
```

But the problem you should have detected is that country and education are considered of type *factor*, that is, R is coercing them as a **categorical variable**. If you do not want that, because these are proper names, you should create your data frame requesting that explicitly:
```{r reCreateDFStrings, eval=FALSE}
students=data.frame(names,ages,country,education,
                    stringsAsFactors=F)
str(students)
```

Notice that in this new version, I am considering *names* as a column and not as the row names; then, R will use numbers in each row by default:
```{r showDF, eval=FALSE}
students
```

The function _str_ showed you the dimensions of the structure (number of rows and columns); R has alternative ways to get the dimensions:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
# rows and columns
dim(students)

#also
nrow(students)  # we have ncol() too!

# and very important:
length(students)
```

We know _length_ works for vectors and lists. In data frames, it gives you number of columns, NOT rows. Data frames have the functions __head()__, which is very useful to show the top rows of the dataframe:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
head(students,2) # top 2
```
Of course, we have __tail__:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
tail(students,2) # last 2
```



You can access data frames elements in an easy way:
```{r accessDF, eval=FALSE}
# one particular column
students$names
# two columns using positions
students[,c(1,4)]
## two columns using names of columns
students[,c('names','education')]
```

Using positions is the best way to get several columns:
```{r getColsDF, eval=FALSE}
students[,c(1:3)] # ':' is used to facilitate 'from-to' sequence
```

Of course, you can create a new object with **subsets**:
```{r subsetDF, eval=FALSE}
studentsNoEd=students[,c(1:3)]
studentsNoEd
```

You can modify any values in a data frame. Let me create a copy of this data frame to play with:
```{r copyDF, eval=FALSE}
studentsCopy=students # I make a copy to avoid altering my original dataframe
```

Now, I can change the age of Qing to 23 replacing 32:
```{r modifyDF, eval=FALSE}
studentsCopy[1,2]=23
# change is immediate! (you will not get any warning)
studentsCopy[1,]
```

We can reset a column as **missing**:
```{r missingColDF, eval=FALSE}
studentsCopy$country=NA
```

And, delete a column by **null**ing it:
```{r deleteColDF, eval=FALSE}
studentsCopy$ages=NULL
```

Then, our copy looks like this:
```{r copyDfShow, eval=FALSE}
studentsCopy
```


### Querying Data Frames:

Once you have a data frame you can start writing interesting queries (notice the use of _commas_):

**Who is the oldest in the group?**
```{r query1, eval=FALSE}
students[which.max(students$ages),] 
```

**Who is the youngest in the group?**
```{r query2, eval=FALSE}
students[which.min(students$ages),] 
```

**Who is above 30 and from China?**
```{r query3, eval=FALSE}
students[students$ages>30 & students$country=='China',] 
```


**Who is not from Norway?**
```{r query4, eval=FALSE}
students[students$country!="Norway",] 
```

**Who is from one of these?**
```{r query5, eval=FALSE}
DangeourousPlaces=c("Peru", "USA", "Spain")
students[students$country %in% DangeourousPlaces,] 
students[!students$country %in% DangeourousPlaces,] # the opposite
```


**The education level of the one above 30 and from China?**
```{r query6, eval=FALSE}
students[students$ages>30 & students$country=='China',]$education 
```

**Show me the data ordered by age (decreasing)?**
```{r query7, eval=FALSE}
students[order(-students$ages),]
```
